Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! This machine learning endeavor aims to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical and physical attributes. In this repository, you will find the necessary code, datasets, and documentation to replicate and extend our predictive model. The primary focus is on utilizing popular machine learning algorithms to analyze and model the relationships between input features and wine quality scores. The code is organized into clear sections, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, we provide a Jupyter notebook for easy exploration and visualization of the dataset. Feel free to contribute, experiment with different algorithms, or enhance the model's performance. We hope this project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing wine quality prediction using machine learning techniques. Cheers to accurate predictions and discovering the nuances of wine quality!
